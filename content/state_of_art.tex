\section{Strong and Weak AI}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) only AI has revolutionized the way we think and develop
new tools. Although this concept is not new, it is important to differentiate
between \emph{weak} and \emph{strong} AI.

When referring to Artificial Intelligence, \citet{searle1980minds} helped to
define the types of AI: \emph{weak AI} refers to a set of algorithms or tools
that approach a solution to a given problem by using strategies based on 
analyzing and reacting through multiple states. However, \emph{strong AI} is
characterized by its capabilities to deeply understand, reason, and react to
unpredictable states, adapting and learning throughout the process of solving
the problem. Since the desgin of \emph{neural networks} in 1949, new techniques
for reaching strong AI have been developed. Although strong AI could be thought
of as an utopia, the subproblems it hides on its path have driven an evolution
in multiple fields. 

In machine learning, neural networks have been significantly improved and
expanded, creating new fields of study such as Deep Learning. This field is
responsible for the creation of \emph{Large Language Models (LLMs)}, where
models named as \textsc{GPT-4} (\citet{achiam2023gpt}), \textsc{Llama2}
(\citet{touvron2023llama}), or \textsc{Gemini} (\citet{saeidnia2023welcome}) have been
trained with billions of iterations over human knowledge, allowing these LLMs to
exhibit emergent properties such as common sense understanding, problem-solving
capabilities, in-context answering, etc. These models are still being improved,
where multi-modality (the capability for working with multiple types of inputs
such as images or audios), pattern recognision or explainability can enhance the
behavior of those models to make them appropiate for the developing of the first
fully cognitive agents.

\section{Agents and Cognition}
\label{sec:agents_and_cognition}

By formatting the output of the models, we make LLMs able to use
multiple \emph{tools}. Tools are a set of functions or utilities that allow
the LLM to interact with its environment. While an LLM can only generate an
output from a given query, agents translate those outputs into actions that
modify the world and optionally the agent's own configuration.

\begin{quote}
    \small\textit{"Agents are only as good as the tools they have"} \citep{langchain-docs-2024}.
\end{quote}

The use of agents has been extended in recent years, where a remarkable
implementation is the \emph{Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)}.  This
architecture is supported over an agent connected to a tool that retrieves
information from a database, empowering the LLM with field- or company-specific
knowledge and improving the accuracy of the models in controlled environments.

The apparition of AI agents enhances the opportunity for further research in the
field of cognition. \emph{Cognition} is a branch of computer science that
investigates the development of systems capable of replicating human
intelligence properties such as reasoning, perception, memory, planning, and
decision-making. Classical cognitivism has been studied since 1956; however, the
interdependent relationship between multiple modules required for a cognitive
architecture has posed a constraint for further research.

\begin{quote}
    \small\textit{
        "We have circles within circles. The central difficulty for problem
        solving was ill-defined problems. In order to deal with them we turned
        to restructuring. In order to address this we turned to analogy and at
        its heart we find ill-defined problem solving as a crucial component.
        Analysis and formaIization have been seriously frustrated in this whole
        endeavour." \citet{vervaeke1999naturalistic}
    }
\end{quote}

Multiple paths have emerged from attempts to define some form of cognitive
intelligence while avoiding a fully intelligent system. For example,
problem-solving has been approached using classical AI
\citep{russell2016artificial}, STRIPS \citep{fikes1971strips}, or PDDL
\citep{aeronautiques1998pddl}. Although these approaches have been successful in
multiple applications, the advent of AI agents opens the door to revisiting the
original study of cognition.

LLMs \emph{break the loop} on the interdependency restriction by approaching
reasoning as a computable optimization problem. AI agents enable these LLMs to
be integrated into a cognitive system, partially solving some architectural
constraints. In line with these architectures, a \emph{cognitive AI agent} is
defined as an agent from which cognitive capabilities emerge, and which is able
to interact, learn, and modify its behavior or environment.

\section{GPS vs AGI}
A \emph{General Problem Solver (GPS)} has been studied in the field of cognition
since 1959 with \citet{newell1959report} who introduced the GPS as an
hypothetical algorithm or set of techniques that decomposes a problem into the
execution of a sequence of operators that combined in the proper way can explore
states and subgoals of the problem until reaching a solution. Although multiple
advances were made in the design of a GPS, further research on this topic were
discontinued due to the limitations of the classical AI and cognition described
in the Section \ref{sec:agents_and_cognition}. 

Similar to the GPS, \emph{Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)} is a new
approach based in the modern AI techniques (LLM based) which is able to
understand, learn and apply knowledge in any cognitive task emulating the
capabilities of a human. Thus, because AGI focus on replicating human
intelligence in a broader sense, problem-solving capabilities emerge as part of
the generalization of the human knowledge, where it is required a new framework
that interacts with this AGI in order to bring those capabilities to the
reality.


\begin{quote}
    \small\textit{
        "Demonstrating that a system can perform a requisite set of tasks at a
        given level of performance should be sufficient for declaring the system
        to be an AGI; deployment of such a system in the open world should not
        be inherent in the definition of AGI" \citet{morris2023levels}
    }
\end{quote}

It is important to note that, although AGI does not necessarily require
interaction with the environment, this term is commonly used by frameworks that
deploy AGI as their main functionality (other common names include autonomous
AI, AGI agents, etc.). Henceforth, we will refer to these architectures as
\emph{AGI deployments}.

There have been multiple implementations of AGI deployments. Some focus on
specializing general knowledge into a specific application, where it is
encapsulated inside a cognitive agent that guides the AI by informing it about
the current status of the environment or the available tools.

An example of a specialized deployment is \textsc{Voyager}. It uses a
three-module-based architecture: the \emph{automatic curriculum}, which
describes the current state of the agent and saves relevant information; the
\emph{iterative prompting mechanism}, which maintains a feedback loop between
the actions coded by the AI and the feedback obtained; and the \emph{skill
library}, which enables the AI to learn and store previous actions and completed
subgoals to encourage tool reuse. By using this architecture, \textsc{Voyager}
demonstrates the capacity to autonomously play the videogame
\emph{Minecraft}, achieving multiple requested goals.


\begin{quote}
    \small\textit{
        "VOYAGER exhibits superior performance in discovering novel items,
        unlocking the Minecraft tech tree, traversing diverse terrains, and
        applying its learned skill library to unseen tasks in a newly
        instantiated world. VOYAGER serves as a starting point to develop
        powerful generalist agents without tuning the model parameters."
        \citet{wang2023voyager}
    }
\end{quote}

Another relevant framework is \textsc{AutoGPT}. This framework eases the
deployment of autonomous agents for minor tasks. It handles task management,
tool selection, multiple prompting techniques, and more. For deploying agents,
\textsc{AutoGPT} provides the so-called \textsc{Forge}, which automatically
connects all the mechanisms and servers needed to not only start running the
agent but also provide the user with various tools to interact and debug in
real-time.


\begin{quote}
    \small\textit{
        "AutoGPT uses the concept of stacking to recursively call itself  [...],
        using this method and with the help of both GPT 3.5 and GPT 4, creates
        full projects by iterating on its own prompts." \citet{fezari2023gpt}
    }
\end{quote}

Similar to AutoGPT, AGI deployments are being extended into projects for company
software assistance (MetaGPT, \cite{alexander2023metagpt}), autonomous
deployments (SuperAGI, \cite{transformer2023superagi}), design-creativity
assistance (AgentGPT, \cite{reworkd2023agentgpt}), and more.

\section{AGI Behavior Techniques}
It has been discussed in previous sections how LLMs can be used to build and
deploy AGIs. However, there are multiple ways to modify or \emph{tune} the
behavior of an AI so it can be successfuly implemented into agents. The
following highlights the key techniques in the state-of-the-art for building
Agents from LLMs:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fine-Tuning:} All LLMs consist of one or multiple layers in a
    deep learning-based neural network. These layers contain a set of parameters
    that define the \textit{knowledge} or behavior of the AI. By training an
    already stable LLM with a field-specific dataset, we can improve the
    accuracy of the AI with the provided knowledge and define the format or
    guidelines it must follow. Although this method obtains better results than
    the following techniques, it may lose emergent properties from the original
    LLM and requires a previous analysis of the provided dataset (bias,
    expectations vs.  results, data cleaning, etc.). In this field, techniques
    such as custom training or freezing can be used to improve the results of
    fine-tuning.

    \item \textbf{Prompt Engineering:} Without modifying the core parameters of
    the LLM, we can still change the expected behavior by introducing a
    goal-crafted prompt that the AI will receive as input and use as guidelines.
    Although this method does not ensure improved accuracy over fine-tuning, it
    does not alter the model's parameters and enables the definition of complex
    reasoning structures. It is important to note that, while security risks for
    AI misbehavior can arise from this method, techniques such as Chain of
    Thought (CoT), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), or Few-Shot prompting
    lead to reasoning properties that have not been achieved with other methods.
    \cite{sahoo2024systematic} delves further into this field.

    \item \textbf{Composition:} By using both prompt engineering and fine-tuning
    methods, it is possible to streamline multiple agents by splitting the
    expected behavior into multiple subgoals. These agents are usually referred
    to as \textit{Experts} and reduce the hallucination of LLMs by distributing
    the attention needed for completing a given query over multiple runs instead
    of a single instance. Some AGI frameworks, such as AutoGen
    \cite{wu2023autogen}, are fully based on this method.

    \item \textbf{Interpretable Feature Excitation:} When using LLMs, abstract
    features appear to have a relationship with visible patterns within the
    parameters of the neural network. These parameters can be excited (e.g.,
    increasing the influence of those parameters on the output) to regulate
    behaviors related to that feature. The research conducted by
    \cite{viteri2024scaling} in this topic opens the door for using this method
    in future agent designs.

\end{itemize}

\section{Cognitive Architectures}
Regardless of the methodology used for building the LLM/Agent, the combination
of mechanisms, tools, and agents constitutes a \emph{cognitive architecture}.

Using classical AI and reinforcement learning, \citet{laird2019soar} introduced
\textsc{Soar} as a unified cognitive architecture that integrates various cognitive
functions such as learning, memory, and problem-solving into a single framework.
\textsc{Soar} employs a decision cycle that involves proposing, evaluating, and selecting
operators based on the current state.

In contemporary research, cognitive architectures have evolved by incorporating
more tools and integrating the capabilities of LLMs as the primary mechanisms.
\citet{wang2024survey} provide an exhaustive survey of the main architectures for
AGI deployments in recent years, describing the \textsc{PMPA} model as an unified
framework that encompasses all the studied architectures.

The PMPA model addresses four main topics that should be implemented by the cognitive architecture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Profile}: Defines the main guidelines and rules for the agents
    implemented, targeting the main goals, knowledge base, and behavior.
    \item \textit{Memory}: Defines the information and data obtained from the
    agent's environment and establishes a structure and mechanism to retrieve,
    codify, and classify the relevant knowledge.
    \item \textit{Planning}: Defines the mechanism which enables the agent to
    decompose the target goal into multiple subgoals, emulating human planning
    capabilities.
    \item \textit{Action}: Defines the mechanism which connects or translates
    the orders requested by the agent into a set of tools that will interact
    with the agent's environment or behavior.
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that, unlike SOAR, this framework does not prescribe
specific methods for connecting each module. Instead, it outlines the primary
properties that a cognitive architecture must possess to be viable for AGI
deployment. Besides PMPA, there are other AGI frameworks, such as the Agent
Protocol-\citet{engineerfoundation2023ap}-, which propose alternative API,
behavior, and module standards. However, further advancements in cognitive
architectures are necessary to establish which standard will ultimately be
adopted.
